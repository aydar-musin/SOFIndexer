How to convert standard IP address format string to hex and long?


        Does anyone know how to get the IP address in decimal or hex from standard IP address format string ("xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx")?

I've tried to use the inet_addr() function but didn't get the right result.

I tested it on "84.52.184.224"

the function returned 3770168404 which is not correct (the correct result is 1412741344).

Thanks!
