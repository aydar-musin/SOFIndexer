How to represent a C# property in UML?


        Not quite an Attribute, not quite a Method. Stereotypes? &lt;&lt;get&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;set&gt;&gt;?



I'm retro-modelling an existing system, so I need to clearly reflect that this is not the same as a readonly field or a methods pair (regardless of what the IL says), so I think I'll go with the stereotype, but I'll accept the language independant get set_ as a general solution. Thanks all for the sanity test.*
