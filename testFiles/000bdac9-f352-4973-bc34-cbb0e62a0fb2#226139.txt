What is a &ldquo;web service&rdquo; in plain English?


        I've been reading about "web services" here on SO, on Wikipedia, Google, etc., and I don't quite understand what they are.  What is the plain English definition/description?

If I make a simple website using PHP that just, say, prints a random integer to the page... is this a "web service"?  If not, why not?
