Logoff script to change user


        Using Windows 2003, I'm look for a way to create a "logoff script" that will continue with the current logoff then immediately login another user.  So, "UserA" logs off.  Script fires to login "UserB".  

This is part of an application upgrade for a computer where we have written the 'shell'; similar to a kiosk application.  For the upgrade we need to logon as 'Adminstrator' then, when the upgrade has completed, logoff 'Administrator' and logon as 'sample_user'.  We would like to accomplish this WITHOUT rebooting.

Note, I do not want a script that will initiate the logoff (i.e. "shutdown").  I'm looking for a script that will run upon the user logging off (set via Group Policies).  As above, the script should log a different user on.

Thanks.
