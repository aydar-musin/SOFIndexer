Free MySQL synchronization tool [closed]


        does anybody know some free tool for synchronization MySQL database (data and structure) like in Navicat for Windows ?



I'm using Structure and Data synchronization. Sometimes Data transfer. I was just wondering if there is not any software like this for free. Found only HeidiSQL (which looks perfect but work worse).
