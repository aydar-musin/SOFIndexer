Multiple mouse pointers?


        Is there a way to accept input from more than one mouse separately? I'm interested in making a multi-user application and I thought it would be great if I could have 2 or more users holding wireless mice each interacting with the app individually with a separate mouse arrow.

Is this something I should try to farm out to some other application/driver/os_magic? or is there a library I can use to accomplish this? Language isn't a HUGE deal, but C, C++, and Python are preferrable.

Thanks :)

Found this multi-pointer toolkit for linux (it's actually a multi-pointer x server):
