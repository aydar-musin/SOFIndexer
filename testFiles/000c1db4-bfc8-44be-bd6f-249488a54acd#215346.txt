Storing Personal Information Dos and Don&#39;ts [closed]


        I run a small php/mysql website for a camera club where users can upload photos. I have recently started storing email addresses for doing password resets. 

My question is what is the best practice for dealing with users' personal information: are there any laws/legislation regarding what I can do with personal information? Do I need to display my policy for dealing with personal information?

Any further information regarding this subject is greatly received.

Thanks
