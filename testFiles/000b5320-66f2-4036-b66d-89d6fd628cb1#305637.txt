What is res://*/ in .net?


        I came across this snippet of code on MSDN:

entityBuilder.Metadata = @"res://*/AdventureWorksModel.csdl|
                            res://*/AdventureWorksModel.ssdl|
                            res://*/AdventureWorksModel.msl";


What does the res://*/ mean and how does it work? I think it has to do with resource files, but I am not sure.

Google is no help because of the punctuation.
